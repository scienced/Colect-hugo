We wish the WHYRED sales team a successful and comfortable preorder intake for AW17!   

WHYRED is: CONTRASTS Where the expected meets the unexpected, in a nonchalant elegance. HERITAGE Well made fashion inspired by classic and historical garments. ART, MUSIC & TAILORING Where a sophisticated mix of different art forms characterize the essence of the brand.  

Colect is: EASY to work with due to the visual presentation and the intuitive way of creating sales orders. EFFICIENT as you don't need to drag around huge sample collections and signed order confirmations will be send directly to your customer and into your backoffice system. FLEXIBLE because it is possible to key in sales orders both on and offline. RELIABLE as you will have up-to-date information about the products, prices, customers, stock levels just at your fingertips. FUN it's true, it just is.
