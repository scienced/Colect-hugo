Customers responded very positively to this additional service, which enables them to keep their shop inventory up-to-date throughout the whole year in an efficient way.  
  
Besides this B2B web portal Vingino was already using the Apps4Fashion mobile order tool used by their sales reps, agents and distributors as well as the instore app to achieve the best possible conversion in their mono brandstores. By adding the B2B web portal to this strategic proposition Vingino is taking full advantage of the added value provided by Apps4Fashion.  
  
We just love working with this great brand and group of dedicated professionals.
