Last week at the European sales meeting at the PUMA AG head quarter in Herzogenaurach the new sales order tool has been warmly welcomed by the Dobotex European sales force. By replacing their existing ordering system with the solution of Colect.io directly integrated with their NAV backoffice system Dobotex will not only speed up the ordering process, it also improves the visual presentation of its divers brand assortments as well as the customer experience while offering a stable, efficient and flexible set of modern sales tools to its international sales team.

"With the implementation of this new Dobotex order tool provided by Colect we have a new state-of-the-art ordering tool which enables our complete salesforce to enter on- and offline orders supported by high resolution pictures on a mobile device, present real-time stock information and realize more efficient customer visits" (Huub Sijbers - IT Dobotex)"
