They implemented the mobile order application of Colect.io to equip their sales team and also launch a B2B web portal to provide their b2b customers 24/7 with direct and easy access to available stock inventory, order- and invoice history as well as order status of running sales orders.  
  
At Colect.io we are happy to add Hinson to an extended list of 300 international fashion, sportswear, footwear and accessory brands and manufacturers which are using our mobile order tools on a day to day basis. This results in 3 Billion EUR of sales orders created on the Colect.io platform by 10.000 sales reps, agents, distributors and approximately 30.000 retailers. With the professional work of NAV Experts, part of Fashion Experts, a direct integration with the K3 Pebblestone ERP system has been setup to provide continuously up-to-date product, price, order and stock inventory information to both their sales team and their b2b customers.
